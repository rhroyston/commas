# [commas.js](https://rack.pub/commas)
## Synopsis

JavaScript Immediately-Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) automatically adds comma delimiters to numbers typed in to an HTML `textarea` or `input` element.  This JavaScript automation is not as easy as it looks!  Give it a try and be sure and partially backspace / delete over previously formatted numbers to see that formatting works in both directions.

## Code Example

A working example of the code is available at [https://rack.pub/commas](https://rack.pub/commas).

## Motivation

Some asshole on Stack Overflow asked for help with this so I created the solution.  A non-working answer got accepted and I never got a single upvote.  The JavaScript ended up being so difficult that I felt it was worthy of posting to my collection of JavaScripts.

## Installation

:checkered_flag: Load via rack.pub's global CDN

`<script src="https://rack.pub/commas/commas.min.js"></script>`

:rocket:  Embed commas.min.js in your javascript when putting in production for best page loading performance.

## API Reference

The auto formatting of numbers is invoked by adding the class `commas`, e.g. `class="commas"`, to one or more HTML `textarea`'s or `input`'s.
